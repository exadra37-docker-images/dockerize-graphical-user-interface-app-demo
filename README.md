# Dockerize Gui App Demo

In this *Dockerize Demo* we will show how simple is to *Dockerize* an *App* that has a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface.

To achieve this we will use:

* [Dockerize GUI App](https://hub.docker.com/r/exadra37/dockerize-graphical-user-interface-app) - Base Docker image to dockerize any GUI App.
* [Dockerize GUI App Demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/exadra37/dockerize-graphical-user-interface-app-demo) - Docker Image to run [Go For It App](http://manuel-kehl.de/projects/go-for-it) that I discovered [here](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker-images/dockerize-graphical-user-interface-app-demo/blob/master/http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/11/go-task-timer-app-ubuntu-desktop).
* [Bash CLI](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker-images/dockerize-graphical-user-interface-app-demo/blob/master/docs/how-to/use.md) to run Dockerize GUI App Demo.

This are the type of branches we can see at any moment in the repository:

* `master` - issues and milestones branches will be merge here.
* `last-stable-release` - matches the last stable tag created. Useful for automation tools.
* `issue-4_fix-email-validation` (issue-number_title) - each issue will have is own branch for development.
* `milestone-12_add-cache` (milestone-number_title) - all Milestone issues will start, track and merged here.

Only `master` and `last-stable-release` branches will be permanent ones in the repository and all other ones will be
removed once they are merged.

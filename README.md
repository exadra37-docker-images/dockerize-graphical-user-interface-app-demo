# GO FOR IT APP - DOCKERIZE DEMO

In this *Dockerize Demo* we will show how simple is to *Dockerize* an *App* that has a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface.

To achieve this we will use:

* [Dockerize GUI App](https://hub.docker.com/r/exadra37/dockerize-graphical-user-interface-app) - Base Docker image to dockerize any GUI App.
* [Dockerize GUI App Demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/exadra37/dockerize-graphical-user-interface-app-demo) - Docker Image to run [Go For It App](http://manuel-kehl.de/projects/go-for-it) that I discovered [here](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/11/go-task-timer-app-ubuntu-desktop).
* [Bash CLI](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker/productivity-tool/go-for-it/blob/master/docs/how-to/use.md) to run Dockerize GUI App Demo.

[Go For It App](http://manuel-kehl.de/projects/go-for-it) is a productivity tool
that helps us to manage our time an keep focus on our daily tasks.
